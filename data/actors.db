spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":3,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"ijcht6woe7iiq3ko":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","ldlqh4oz9wkbna34":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{"added":{"xzlttr76u5if329y":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"externalactor":{"labels":{}}}},{"_id":"ijcht6woe7iiq3ko","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":3500000,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.items.LBajgahniRJbAgDr"},"externalactor":{"labels":{}}}},{"_id":"AXfWI5f2DScz5sEe","name":"Rations","type":"consumable","img":"icons/consumables/meat/hock-leg-pink-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 153","quantity":17,"weight":2,"price":0.5,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":"1","per":"charges","autoDestroy":true,"autoUse":true},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"food","attuned":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":1800000,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.FQpJpWjX9bsPZvDo"},"externalactor":{"labels":{"activation":"1 Action","target":"1 Creature","range":"Touch","duration":"","recharge":"Recharge [undefined]","damage":"","damageTypes":"","abilityCheck":"undefined Ability Check"}}}},{"_id":"UnMwCHGKyMoIAQwm","name":"Thieves' Tools","type":"tool","img":"icons/tools/hand/lockpicks-steel-grey.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Cultist","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Cultist.webp","actorId":"qkLNA1lKMMJpxuWg","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-quilted-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order.

The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath.

Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time;

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":4600000,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.items.LBajgahniRJbAgDr"},"externalactor":{"labels":{}}}},{"_id":"EJovFR47konlvmF3","name":"Speak to small animals","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"siftoolkit":{"SIFData":{"ignoreDuration":false,"texture":"","useTexture":false,"alpha":50,"coneOrigin":1,"loopAnimations":true,"playTemplateAudio":false,"playDamageAudio":false,"playSaveAudio":false,"clip":"","volume":100}},"externalactor":{"labels":{"featType":"Action","activation":"Action","target":"","range":"","duration":"","recharge":"Recharge [null]","damage":"","damageTypes":"","abilityCheck":"undefined Ability Check"}}},"siftoolkit":{"audio":{"playDamageAudio":false,"playSaveAudio":false,"clip":{"text":""},"volume":100}}},{"_id":"2q7DeusfBFrGE5TO","name":"Mage Hand (Arcane Trickster)","type":"spell","img":"icons/magic/water/water-hand.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range.

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Ash Zombie","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.webp","actorId":"NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null}},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","img":"icons/skills/melee/unarmed-punch-fist-yellow-red.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.4Ae2SPZRXEVbVs0M]{Circle of the Land}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"druid","levels":3,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6pdotglp4hy4zlvb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"]},"value":{"added":{"mq7aft43zn80ksgr":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","mukslab94jgo077m":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v","80d2yi0ejhmvn826":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","4ou86wshuy79bmdg":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"]},"value":{"added":{"lzhg8w9w2vk3q50m":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","xgy6l924veangfnq":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"r3xhzsz7noff50w3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.cVDEQo0ow1WJT7Wl","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.xvgPu1O57DgXCM86"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"pkfb1a2u37665epq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ip4bvmGoz3qkoqes"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"qv0gbr1rb5889ubd","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"},"externalactor":{"labels":{}}}},{"_id":"80d2yi0ejhmvn826","name":"Druidic","type":"feat","img":"icons/sundries/documents/document-torn-diagram-tan.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

CR</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Limitations</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Example</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>1/4</td>\n<td>No flying or swimming speed</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.yawTeS8u2FCfzzZH]{Wolf}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>1/2</td>\n<td>No flying speed</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.8aCTKP5qaBPFOqxM]{Crocodile}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>--</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.9bHoR8k5D2DKHaF3]{Giant Eagle}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p><p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 66","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":null,"type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":2,"max":"@classes.druid.levels > 19 ?

The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath.

Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities).

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Zombie","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.webp","actorId":"NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","img":"icons/skills/melee/unarmed-punch-fist-yellow-red.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Ash Zombie","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.webp","actorId":"NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null}},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","img":"icons/skills/melee/unarmed-punch-fist-yellow-red.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes.

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Cultist","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Cultist.webp","actorId":"qkLNA1lKMMJpxuWg","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-quilted-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p>\n<p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p>\n<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":4600000,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.items.LBajgahniRJbAgDr"},"externalactor":{"labels":{}}}},{"_id":"jNNrJajgwWlxM52p","name":"Longsword +1 (silver-chased scabbard)","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/swords/greatsword-crossguard-steel.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Whether through demonic blessing, celestial bequeathment, crazed experiment, or skillful craft, this weapon has been enhanced to bring more bloodshed by the bearer.</em></p>\n<p>You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"DMG pg. 213","quantity":1,"weight":3,"price":1000,"attunement":0,"equipped":true,"rarity":"uncommon","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":"1","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["1d8 + @mod +1","slashing"]],"versatile":"1d10 + @mod +1"},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"weaponType":"martialM","baseItem":"longsword","properties":{"ver":true,"amm":false,"hvy":false,"fin":false,"fir":false,"foc":false,"lgt":false,"lod":false,"rch":false,"rel":false,"ret":false,"spc":false,"thr":false,"two":false,"mgc":true,"ada":false,"sil":false},"proficient":true,"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":1200000,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.items.IPkf0XNowClwXnjQ"},"siftoolkit":{"SIFData":{"ignoreDuration":false,"texture":"","useTexture":false,"alpha":50,"coneOrigin":1,"loopAnimations":true,"playTemplateAudio":false,"playDamageAudio":false,"playSaveAudio":false,"clip":"","volume":100}},"externalactor":{"labels":{"activation":"1 Action","target":"","range":"5 Feet","duration":"","recharge":"Recharge [undefined]","damage":"1d8 + @mod +1","damageTypes":"Slashing","abilityCheck":"undefined Ability Check","toHit":"+ 2","derivedDamage":[{"formula":"1d8","damageType":"slashing","label":"1d8 Slashing"}]}}},"siftoolkit":{"audio":{"playDamageAudio":false,"playSaveAudio":false,"clip":{"text":""},"volume":100}}},{"_id":"Vd4blifyo8Tmvv0w","name":"Rations","type":"consumable","img":"icons/consumables/meat/hock-leg-pink-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 153","quantity":14,"weight":2,"price":0.5,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":"1","per":"charges","autoDestroy":true,"autoUse":true},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"consumableType":"food","attuned":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":1800000,"permission":{"default":0,"O76CQXe99TngGXSx":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.IUsB73tFTMjgMbFv"},"siftoolkit":{"SIFData":{"ignoreDuration":false,"texture":"","useTexture":false,"alpha":50,"coneOrigin":1,"loopAnimations":true,"playTemplateAudio":false,"playDamageAudio":false,"playSaveAudio":false,"clip":"","volume":100}},"externalactor":{"labels":{"activation":"1 Action","target":"1 Creature","range":"Touch","duration":"","recharge":"Recharge [undefined]","damage":"","damageTypes":"","abilityCheck":"undefined Ability Check"}}},"siftoolkit":{"audio":{"playDamageAudio":false,"playSaveAudio":false,"clip":{"text":""},"volume":100}}},{"_id":"tr4RZzwHQtuy80bA","name":"Waterskin","type":"consumable","img":"icons/sundries/survival/wetskin-leather-purple.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A leather hide sewn into an enclosed skin which can contain up to 4 pints of liquid.

In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"0rezvlf2ul1kjm7d":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","mb3aiiyoga49hld8":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"},"externalactor":{"labels":{}}}},{"_id":"0rezvlf2ul1kjm7d","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.
